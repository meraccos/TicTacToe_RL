# Tabular Reinforcement Learning applied on Tic Tac Toe

This repository attempts to teach a tabular reinforcement learning agent to learn playing tic-tac-toe. The work is still under development, currently winning at ~98% success rate.


To start the training, run python3 tabular.py

Memory is automatically saved in memory.txt. Example working memories are given in good_memory.txt and best_memory.txt 

To play against the AI, run python3 human.py. You can specify the trained memory file.
